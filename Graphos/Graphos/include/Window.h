/**
* @class Window
* @brief Encapsulates an SFML RenderWindow for rendering and window management.
*
* The Window class provides a high-level interface for creating and managing a graphical window
* using the SFML library. It supports window creation, event handling, drawing operations, and
* resource management. The class is designed to be used as the main rendering target in a graphical
* application, handling all window-related operations internally.
*
* Example usage:
* @code
* Window window(800, 600, "My Application");
* while (window.isOpen()) {
*   window.handleEvents();
*   window.clear();
*   // Draw your objects here
*   window.display();
* }
* @endcode
